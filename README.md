# MAGD 150 Assignments

This is the repository list for MAGD 150.

This [link](https://github.com/TheWatcher002/MAGD150Assignment/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab04_Schrader) is to my fourth work. This work is a pizza theme with a text put in the console and a pepperoni flying up off the pizza.

This [link](https://github.com/TheWatcher002/MAGD150Assignment/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab05_Schrader) is to my fifth work. This work is a TV theme with a TV in the center. When the on button is pressed there is a ball bouncing back and forth. When the off button is pressed, the TV turns off and you can not see the bouncing ball.

This [link](https://github.com/TheWatcher002/MAGD150Assignment/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab06_Schrader) is my sixth work. This work is an 8bit theme. I chose Tetris as my theme and the program has a few features. There is one user responsive piece, where if you click with the mouse, a T-piece rotates. There is another T-piece that is pulsating where the user T-piece should go.

This [link](https://github.com/TheWatcher002/MAGD150Assignment/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab09_Schrader) is my ninth work. This work is a mirror theme. I choose to do an actual mirror with a main figure on it and his transparent figure in the foreground. Also in the mirror is another darker figure behind the main figure. When you click on a button, some unsettling sound plays. Another feature is the program uses the webcam and projects it into one of the corners of the canvas.

This [link](https://github.com/TheWatcher002/MAGD150Assignment/tree/gh-pages/f21magd150lab10_Schrader) is my tenth work. This work is a city theme. In this project, there are a few 3D objects, two rectangle blocks and one dumpster. There is also a light source that follows the mouse as well as some ambient sources. The last feature of this project is the swiveling camera that looks left and right.
